# API_Challenge

**Purpose**
Harness the power of API requests and JSON traversal to look at climate trends based on latitude and longitude of randomly generated cities. 

**Create Series of Scatter Plots to Showcase Relationships**
* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude

![temp v. lat](lat vs temp.pdf)

* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude 


* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude 


* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude 


**Linear Regressions for Each Relationship Divided by Northern and Southern Hemisphere's**
* Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude 


* Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude 


* Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude 


* Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude 


* Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude 


* Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude 


* Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude


* Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude 


observations:
1. temperature increases as latitude gets closer to 0 (the equator) and decreases away from the equator 
2. Trend for average humidity to be higher as you get closer to the equator 
3. There was no correlation between wind speed and latitude.
