# API_Challenge

**Purpose**
Harness the power of API requests and JSON traversal to look at climate trends based on latitude and longitude of randomly generated cities. 

**Create Series of Scatter Plots to Showcase Relationships**
* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude

* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude 

![hum v. lat](/readme_images/lat_v_humidity.PNG)
______________________________________________________________________________________

* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude 

![cloud v. lat](/readme_images/lat_v_cloud.PNG)
______________________________________________________________________________________

* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

**Linear Regressions for Each Relationship Divided by Northern and Southern Hemisphere's**
* Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude 

![n temp v lat](/readme_images/n_lat_v_temp.PNG)

* As latitude increases towards the north pole temperature also decreases. This demonstrates a negative relationship between latitude and temperature in the northern hemisphere

* Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude 

![s temp v lat](/readme_images/s_lat_v_temp.PNG)

* As latitude increases from -60 at the south pole temperature also increases. This demonstrates a positive relationship between latitude and temperature in the souther hemisphere. 

**Takeaway** 
* As you move closer to the equator global temperatures increase. The further you are from the equator the lower the temperature is.

* Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude 

![n hum v lat](/readme_images/n_lat_v_hum.PNG)

* There does not seem to be any correlation between humidity and latitude. At any latitude you can expect any range of humidities. Could be interesting to look at other factors such as elevation and distance to large bodies of water. 

* Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude 

![s hum v lat](/readme_images/s_lat_v_hum.PNG)

* Again, like in the northern hemisphere latitude doesn't seem to have any bearing on humidity. 

**Takeaway**
* There is no demonstrated relationship between humidity and latitude. It could be interesting to look at factors such as elevation and distance to bodies of water. These factors could have a greater impact on humidity than latitude.

* Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude 

![n cloud v lat](/readme_images/n_lat_v_cloud.PNG)

* There doesn't seem to be any relationship between latitude and cloudiness 

* Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude 

![s cloud v lat](/readme_images/s_lat_v_cloud.PNG)

* There doesn't seem to be any relationship between latitude and cloudiness

* Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

![n_lat_v_wind](/readme_images/n_lat_v_cloud.PNG)

* Outlier makes it difficult to determine if there is any correlation between windspeed and latitude. If outlier was removed the graph could be scaled to better understand what's going on here. 

* Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude 

![s lat v wind](/readme_images/s_lat_v_cloud.PNG)

observations:
1. temperature increases as latitude gets closer to 0 (the equator) and decreases away from the equator 
2. Trend for average humidity to be higher as you get closer to the equator 
3. There was no correlation between wind speed and latitude.
